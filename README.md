# Image Classification and Object Detection to detect Traffic Rules Violations

## Overview

This project implements a Traffic Fine Charging System that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies to read vehicle number plates. The system then identifies traffic violations and notifies violators within 1-2 minutes using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Additionally, an end-to-end framework has been published, achieving an impressive precision rate of over 85% with the Object Detection YOLO (You Only Look Once) model.

## Features

- **License Plate Recognition:** Utilizes OCR technology to accurately read vehicle number plates.
- **Traffic Violation Detection:** Identifies and categorizes traffic violations based on the analyzed data.
- **Real-time Notification:** Notifies violators promptly within 1-2 minutes through email using the SMTP protocol.
